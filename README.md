This will document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running as soon as I find out what that is.

* System dependencies: Linux only for now

* Configuration: None

* Database creation: None

* Database initialization: None

* How to run the test suite: TextExclude is packaged as a gem in ~/workspace/TextExclude/gem/TextExclude/lib, run rake test

  I have yet to figure out how to run the gem in test.
