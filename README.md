# TextExclude

This README will document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running once I figure out what they are.

Things I do know:

* This was written using ruby 2.3
* Only works with linux for now due to using files
* Configuration: none
* Database creation: None
* Database initialization: None
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.): None
* Deployment instructions: Not yet

## Installation

Assure Bundler is installed

    $ gem install bundler

Install dependencies

    $ bundle install

Then execute text_include

    $ bundle exec exe/text_exclude

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Run `rake test` to run the tests, or run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt to experiment.

<!--
To install this gem onto your local machine, run
`bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version
number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which
will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and
push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
