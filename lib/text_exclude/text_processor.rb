  # About the text_area:
  # * text_area full line format is [control_number, line_actual [control type, count or data in line]] as a hash
  # * text_area control format is control_number ["before", count of lines preceding] or ["text", data in line] as an array
  #
  # parameters are normalized to act as a range
  
  # 1. Additional include pattern
  # This builds a hash table of the initial included lines.
  # * It runs a search history to support multiple includes.
  # * It does the Regexp matching for each pattern for each line.
  # * Everything is counted and excluded until a match is found.
  # * At that point the excluded count is written and text follows.
  # This logic repeats until the "after count is written if required.

    # is needed for rebuilding the display with actions requiring additional excludes. Clearly if the prior exclude ends
